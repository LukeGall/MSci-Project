# LaTeX Notes

This document will be used to write some notes about the latex document and how to write up different parts of the maths. 

## Packages 
* etex - support stuff, don't need to worry
* calc - allows calculations within the paper
* TikZ - Graphic elements, likely used for the state machine graphic at the end of the paper
* /listings - Source code printer
* /url - URLs 

### Macros
Some macros for common commands, most are probably easy to grasp when used in the paper. Including selection, selection with indexes etc. Best looking at the macros when needing it. 

* /math_macros - The same as above with more focus on maths stuff, again easier to understand in the paper. 
* /proof-dashed - proof stuff
* /prooftree - Build proof trees for natural deduction. Very useful for premise, conclusion tree stuff
* /mathpartir - Math Paragraph for Typesetting Inference Rules
