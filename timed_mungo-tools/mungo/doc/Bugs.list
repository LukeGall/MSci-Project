1.	Java1.4 compiler does not recognise the import a_package.Aprotocol
	when Aprotocol is a typestate source. It throws an exception.

2.	Problems with the return type of recursive method call when the
	type of the return value carries a typestate.

3.	Problems with the conditional operator (expr) ? (expr1) : (expr2);
	when the exrpessions handle variables that carry a typestate.

4.	An expression of the form new AnObject() that is not assigned to
	a variable will not be checked for typestate consistency if
	AnObject class carries a typestate.

5.	Does not typecheck variables when they are declared in the body
	of a switch statement and their type carries a typestate.

6.	Does not typecheck the body of a try-catch statement. The intention
	for the moment is to at least typecheck the body of the try block on
	the assumption that all thrown exceptions terminate the program.
	A complete typecheck for the body of a try-catch satement requires
	more study of the theory for typestate and exceptions.
