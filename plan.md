* Week 3 (4/10)
    * Plan drafted. Meeting with supervisor and reading more papers.
* Week 4 (11/10)
    * Start trying to extend the core calculus of Mungo, runtime syntax, begin to think about how to infer and subtype clock constraints, following the system found in Mungo.

    * Try to add the type inference rules for time constraints, decide on which way to subtype. 
* Week 6 (25/10)

* Week 7 (1/11)
    * Work on finishing up and cleaning up the theory, should almost be ready to start writing up the proofs soon
* Week 8 (8/11)
    * Finish up main part of the theory, clean up the LaTeX file with the figures then send it over. Maybe look at how the proofs will go, or get some ideas down for which examples I'll use to showcase the theory. Started the lit review
* Week 9 (15/11)
    * Clean up the LaTeX file and continue with the lit review
* Week 10 (22/11)
