# Meeting 10 (first of spring semester)

*  Large typestate example written up, first as a protocol then a typestate
* Created a larger Message Stack exmaple to show the use of time for a single class
* Then made a message stack user which is the main example that is typed 
* Example covers subtyping, delays, delays in other methods, and different branches
* Began work on proofs, not quite as smooth as previous work. Got a bit stuck on the proofs from the Lemmas from Mungo and not entirely sure how to start them but went through a made some progress
