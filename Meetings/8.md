# Meeting 8

* Should have the first draft of the lit review for you today

# Questions
* Do you have any examples of how a good project proposal is written or any preferences how I should tackle the sections?
* For the progress section of the report, should I show some of the rules and typing stuff (but not all as I won't have enough space)?
