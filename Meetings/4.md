# Meeting 4

# Weekly Progress
* Spent most of the week working on the inference rules for classes and methods 
    * Can use the existing and rules and then have time checking another way
* Researched the ways to check for time consistency, mainly taking the options from the Scribble style paper which checks that typestates are infinitely satisfiable
* Wrote up a large example of inference and then subtyping to make sure it worked
* When going through the example, it was clear that the current rules would not allow a method expression to use a delay call.
    * This can either stay as the case if we need it for the 'abstraction principle' 
    * Another way is to allow delays in calls, this can be updated with the convert, removeDelays rule
* The inferred typestate grammar has been updated to allow branches with and without time
    * The join function was then updated as well as the rules
* Updated the LaTeX file some more
    *

# Questions
* How exactly does the enum subtyping work, it doesn't attach labels so I assume it uses the Set and Method subtyping rules 
* When subtyping something with no time, it may just be easier to have it as an empty set of clocks as the current rules and reductions would still work.
* Still not very sure when S-Class would be used either


# Minutes 
A good meeting overall that helped clarify a few things to do with how Enums are correctly subtyped and making sure that the logic I had about using the delay methods make sense.
