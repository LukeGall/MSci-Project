# Meeting 12 

*  Wrote up the proofs and then worked on the examples written up in LaTeX as well but will need a clean up

* Good meeting, helped explain how to move the design forward more with the proof systems. To start next week is to have another look at how to reword the proof statement and how to make it more formal and less clunky to read. 2 draft collaries should also be drawn from this also.
