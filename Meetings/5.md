# Meeting 5

# Weekly Progress
* Fully updated the LaTeX project definitions fill with all my theory I've fully written up, a good amount of text was written to describe my thoughts, and it is hopefully a good starting point for the december report.
* Had a better look at how the inf. set, and feasibility checking would work for Mungo. Certainly useful to focus on making checks for inf. sat. as this would be required for the Mungo system to correctly work as it'll need to unfold a recursive function once.
    * Inf. Sat. is definitely something I want to work a little bit more on as a rough checker for Mungo later down the line, taking the definition from the MPST paper and updating it to the typestate syntax. This would need to be identical to ensure no discrepancies between a typestate that StMungo would produce.  

# Questions
* When should I start the december report? Next week? or week after?
* Should I start working on the proofs now? How to start?


# Minutes 
Good meeting overall, focused on the work done the last two days which focused more on getting some initial theory down on inf. sat. and feasibility plus a short discussion on getting the definitions sent over with more text in it. Once the initial definitions are sent off, work can begin on the related work / literature review section of the report.
